  # Welcome to Music Attention!
A game to improve and practice your attention with music and notes!

 The games  starts with a tutorial, teaching when listening to a specific sound on one side of the headset / audio output, press that same side on the game screen.
 The goal of the game is to raise your focus and attention, based on the test of people with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), in which they need to focus on sounds by touching the sides of the handset and pressing a button.
 

* When you hear the sound shown before coming from the left, press on the left.
* When you hear the sound shown before coming from the right, press on the right.
* With each hit, you get 100 points. There are a total of 32 notes, that is, 3200 points.
* If you hit the note, the background will glow green, as in the following image
